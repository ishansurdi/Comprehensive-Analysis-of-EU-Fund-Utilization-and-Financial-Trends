# Comprehensive Analysis of EU Fund Utilization and Financial Trends

## Overview
This repository contain a detailed analysis of the utilization of EU funds, focusing on financial trends, fund allocation efficiency, and policy implications. The project evaluates planned vs. actual payments, regional fund distribution, pre-financing trends, and anomalies observed during the programming period 2014–2025. The visualizations and findings aim to contribute to discussions on financial efficiency and equitable resource allocation.

## Features
- Analysis of planned vs. actual payments for EU Regional Policy (2014–2025).
- Cumulative payment trends by country and geographic regions.
- Recovery of initial pre-financing vs. net pre-financing.
- Fund allocation by program, including disparities among EU member states.
- Payment rate trends and year-over-year changes in decommitments.
- Policy recommendations to improve fund utilization and reduce inefficiencys.

## Project Highlights
- **Dataset**: The analysis uses publicly available data from the European Data Portal ([dataset link](http://data.europa.eu/88u/dataset/vs2b-dct3)), which is not covered by this projects license.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Tableau for data visualization, Microsoft Word for documentation, and this repository for hosting all relevant files.
- **Policy Relevance**: Findings are aligned with the EU’s objectives to bridge regional disparities and improve fund allocation efficiency.

## Key Findings
### 1. Planned vs. Actual Payments
- A significant gap was observed between planned and actual payments in the initial years (2014–2016) due to administrative delays.
- From 2017 onwards, the gap narrowed, reflecting improved project execution and fund utilization.

### 2. Cumulative Payments by Country
- Larger economies like Germany and Spain dominate funding totals, while smaller nations show lower allocations.
- Geographic disparities highlights the need for better support mechanisms for countries with low absorption rates.

### 3. Pre-Financing Trends
- Net pre-financing stabilized post-2020, indicating program maturity.
- Minimal recovery in earlier years (2014–2016) suggest an initial focus on fund distribution over recovery.

### 4. Fund Allocation by Program
- The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) accounted for the largest share of allocations, emphasizing sustainable development and infrastructure growth.
- Disparities in allocation suggest a need for targeted strategys for smaller economies.

### 5. Year-over-Year Decommitments
- Increasing decommitments from 2022 to 2024 reflect inefficiencys in fund absorption and execution delays.
- Stabilized trends during 2020–2021 indicates successful interim strategies that could be replicated.

## Policy Recommendations
- Streamline administrative processes to reduce initial delays in fund allocation.
- Enhance project monitoring to identify risks and ensure timely execution.
- Introduce flexible fund reallocation mechanisms to adress underperformance.
- Support capacity building in member states to improve project planning and execution.
